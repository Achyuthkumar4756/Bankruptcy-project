# Bankruptcy Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves developing a predictive model to identify companies at risk of bankruptcy. The model aims to aid financial analysts and decision-makers in proactive risk management and intervention strategies.

## Objectives
- **Predict Bankruptcy**: Develop a robust model to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy for companies based on financial data and other relevant indicators.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key features and their relationships.
- **Model Development**: Implement and evaluate various machine learning algorithms to determine the best-performing model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset was sourced from publicly available financial records, including balance sheets, income statements, and macroeconomic indicators.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Scaled features using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for normalization.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized data distributions and relationships using seaborn and matplotlib.
   - Analyzed summary statistics to understand the central tendency and variability of features.
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features based on domain knowledge.
   - Selected important features through correlation analysis and statistical tests.
5. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Used cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.
   - Selected the best model based on performance metrics and validation results.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: The final model achieved an accuracy of X%, with high precision and recall, effectively identifying companies at risk of bankruptcy.
- **Feature Importance**: Key financial ratios and indicators significantly contributed to the model's predictive power.
- **Visualization**: Provided visual insights into the data and model performance through comprehensive charts and plots.
